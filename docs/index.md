# Welcome to Hardwatt documentation

This documentation provides a description of the Hardwatt project. Hardwatt project provides a tool for establishing a secure configuration posture for server hosted in Openwatt infrastruture.

The secure configuration recommandations are based on the 
CIS Security Benchmarks program which provides industry best practices to help organizations assess and improve their security. 

To obtain the latest version of the CIS Security Benchmarks please visit http://benchmarks.cisecurity.org.

!! Caution !!

The security hardening is highly recommended to be performed during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be
performed before hardening the system.
